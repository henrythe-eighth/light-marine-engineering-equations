## How to use this script 

- First make sure that you have Python 3 downloaded, if not, download it. I'm not going to go into how to do that here as there are a million tutorials online.
- Then:

### FOR WINDOWS SYSTEMS

- Open Windows Powershell
- Run the command:
`python main.py`
  making sure that you are in the right directory (again, look it up)
  
- Then follow the prompts it gives

### FOR MACOS + LINUX

- Open Terminal
- Run the command: `python3 main.py`
making sure you are in the correct directory. If you put the script in Downloads, run the command `cd Downloads` and press `TAB` for autocomplete then `ENTER`
  
- Follow the prompts.
